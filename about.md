# About the Author

I didn't write this book to inspire anyone.

I wrote it because trauma has a way of making people doubt their own reality — and I'm done letting that happen.

My work blends lived experience with neuroscience, attachment theory, and trauma research. I focus on how Complex PTSD actually operates in the body: the amygdala, the HPA axis, the vagus nerve — not just feelings, but systems.

This book is what I needed years before I had the language to ask for it.

## Why This Book Exists

"I didn't write this book to tell a story of victimization; I wrote it to dismantle the lie that we are permanently broken by what happened to us. Every single person who has survived a storm carries the blueprint for their own healing within them. We just have to learn how to read the map."

## Background

Daniel Lingar is an advocate, writer, and teacher focused on the intersection of complex trauma, addiction recovery, and nervous system regulation.

*From the Storm to the Fire* is his first memoir, chronicling his personal journey out of the trauma-to-chaos blueprint and into self-sovereignty.

This book exists because surviving without understanding costs people years of their lives.  
Language is the difference between self-blame and agency.
