# About the Author: Daniel Lingar

Daniel Lingar is an advocate, writer, and teacher focused on the intersection of complex trauma, addiction recovery, and nervous system regulation.

*From the Storm to the Fire* is his first memoir, chronicling his personal journey out of the trauma-to-chaos blueprint and into self-sovereignty.

### Why This Book?

"I didn't write this book to tell a story of victimization; I wrote it to dismantle the lie that we are permanently broken by what happened to us. Every single person who has survived a storm carries the blueprint for their own healing within them. We just have to learn how to read the map."

### Contact & Work

Daniel lives in [Your City, State] with his partner and their two loud dogs. He holds a degree in [Your Field] and currently works as a [Your Profession/Role].
