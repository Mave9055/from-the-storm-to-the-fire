  <h1>About the Author</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; font-style: italic; color: #555; max-width: 700px; margin: 1.5rem auto;">
    I didn't write this book to inspire anyone. I wrote it because trauma has a way of making people doubt their own reality — and I'm done letting that happen.

## The Work

My work blends **lived experience** with neuroscience, attachment theory, and trauma research. I focus on how Complex PTSD actually operates in the body: the **amygdala**, the **HPA axis**, the **vagus nerve** — not just feelings, but systems.

This book is what I needed years before I had the language to ask for it.

## Why This Book Exists

> "I didn't write this book to tell a story of victimization; I wrote it to dismantle the lie that we are permanently broken by what happened to us. Every single person who has survived a storm carries the blueprint for their own healing within them. We just have to learn how to read the map."

## Background

**Daniel Lingar** is an advocate, writer, and teacher focused on the intersection of complex trauma, addiction recovery, and nervous system regulation.

*From the Storm to the Fire* is his first memoir, chronicling his personal journey out of the trauma-to-chaos blueprint and into self-sovereignty.

His approach combines:

- **Neuroscience-grounded understanding** of trauma and the nervous system
- **Lived experience** with Complex PTSD and recovery
- **Practical frameworks** like the Glass Box Blueprint for healing
- **Fierce honesty** about the real cost of survival

### The Mission

**This book exists because surviving without understanding costs people years of their lives.**

Language is the difference between self-blame and agency.

Understanding is the difference between repeating patterns and breaking free.

This memoir gives you both.
