# Chapter 1 — Born Alert

They say I was born early.

I’ve always felt late.

Seven months in, dragged out before I was finished. Three pounds, four ounces—barely assembled, lungs unprepared for air, nerves unprepared for light. Instead of arms, I was placed in glass and wires. Machines breathed for me. Monitors watched me closer than any human ever could.

I don’t remember the NICU.

But my body does.

It remembers the distance. The way closeness still tightens my chest. The way noise crawls under my skin. The sense that life has always been happening just beyond a transparent wall—visible, loud, but never fully reachable.

A few days after I was born, my systems began to fail. Alarms sounded. A priest was called to the incubator. Last rites were spoken over a body that hadn’t yet learned how to live. Words meant to prepare a soul for leaving were spoken before I’d even arrived.

I don’t know what changed.

Maybe stubbornness.  
Maybe grace.  

Whatever it was, my vitals rose. The machines quieted. The priest left. I stayed.

That glass box became my first lesson.

Stay still.  
Stay quiet.  
Don’t need too much.  

Survive.

Some people learn safety through touch, through warmth, through being held. I learned it through stillness. Through silence. Through not setting off alarms. My nervous system learned early that existence itself could be dangerous—that taking up space might cost me everything.

I grew, technically. I left the hospital. Life moved forward.

But something stayed behind in that box.

It shows up when people get too close. When voices rise. When rooms are crowded. My chest tightens. My body braces. I scan for exits without thinking. I don’t relax—I monitor.

This isn’t fear the way people talk about fear. It’s not panic yet. It’s readiness. A constant low-level alertness, like my body never fully stood down from its first emergency.

Born watching.  
Born waiting.  
Born prepared for things to go wrong.

I didn’t know it then, but that beginning would echo through everything that came after. Every relationship. Every addiction. Every instinct to disappear rather than demand. Every moment where silence felt safer than truth.

Before the storm ever arrived, I was already wired for it.

I didn’t enter the world curious.

I entered it alert.
