# Chapter 12 — Emotional Flashbacks

I used to think I was overreacting.

That was the word everyone used. Too sensitive. Too intense. Too much. When something small set me off, I’d feel it immediately—heat in my chest, pressure behind my eyes, the urge to flee or fight or disappear entirely.

Nothing in the room justified the response.

That’s what made it so humiliating.

There were no images. No memories playing on repeat. No clear trigger I could point to and say, *that’s why*. Just a sudden collapse into something heavy and familiar, like the present had folded in on itself.

I didn’t know I was flashing back.

I thought I was failing at adulthood.

An emotional flashback doesn’t drag you into the past visually. It drags the past into your body. The same dread. The same helplessness. The same certainty that something terrible is about to happen and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.

Your mind looks around and sees a kitchen, an office, a text message.

Your body feels five years old under a blanket, waiting for the noise to stop.

Logic becomes useless in those moments. People would tell me to calm down, to think it through, to stop catastrophizing. I wanted to. I just couldn’t. My nervous system had already decided the situation was dangerous, and it wasn’t interested in debate.

Once the alarm sounded, everything narrowed.

My chest tightened. My thoughts scattered. I’d feel trapped even when I wasn’t. I’d shut down mid-conversation or explode over something that didn’t matter on its own. Later, I’d replay it all with shame, asking myself why I couldn’t just respond like a normal person.

The answer wasn’t weakness.

It was memory without words.

The body doesn’t remember the way the mind does. It remembers patterns. Pressure. Tone. Proximity. Loss of control. When something in the present matches enough of the old pattern, the system reacts as if the original danger has returned.

Not because it’s stupid.

Because it’s fast.

Emotional flashbacks made intimacy feel unsafe. A raised eyebrow could feel like rejection. Silence could feel like abandonment. Conflict—even mild—could send me spiraling into a place where everything felt at risk.

I wasn’t responding to what was happening.

I was responding to what *had happened before*.

The most confusing part was how convincing it felt. In the middle of a flashback, the story in my head felt airtight. *This always happens. I’m about to lose everything. I need to fix this now or disappear.*

Afterward, when the intensity faded, the story fell apart. I’d look back and barely recognize myself. Apologies followed. Explanations. Promises to do better.

None of that prevented the next one.

Because you can’t out-apologize a nervous system.

Understanding emotional flashbacks didn’t stop them immediately. But it did something just as important: it gave me a pause. A fraction of space where I could say, *this feels old.*

That sentence didn’t solve the moment.

But it cracked it open.

For the first time, I could see that the intensity wasn’t proof that I was broken. It was proof that my body was reacting to something it had survived before and never been allowed to release.

The past wasn’t haunting me.

It was living in my nervous system.

And it was finally asking to be acknowledged.
