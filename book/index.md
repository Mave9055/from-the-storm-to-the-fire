# FROM THE STORM TO THE FIRE
## A Survival Story Told Backwards: from damage → meaning → agency

### The only way out is through the flame.

This book is for anyone who has been told they are "too sensitive," who has mistaken hypervigilance for self-sufficiency, or who is tired of carrying the weight of a childhood they didn't choose.

It is a memoir about surviving NICU trauma, domestic violence, and a decades-long struggle with addiction, only to realize the real enemy was the internal *blueprint* of chaos I'd built for myself.

**This is the true story of how I learned to stop fighting the fire, and instead, command the ember.**

> "The final, quiet truth is this: your trauma didn't make you broken; it made you adaptable. The intense sensitivity that once caused hypervigilance is now the depth of your empathy."
