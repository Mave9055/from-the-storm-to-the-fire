# Chapter 2 — When Safety Shattered

The first time I learned the world could turn on you, I was five.

Not in a big, cinematic way. Not with warning. It arrived quietly, disguised as normal life adjusting itself after a divorce. New house. New routines. A new man in the rooms where my father used to be.

At first, nothing seemed wrong. Adults talked. Kids adapted. I learned early that change wasn’t something you questioned—it was something you absorbed.

Then the air shifted.

It wasn’t one moment. It was a pattern. A tone that hardened. A presence that filled rooms like pressure. His voice carried an edge that made my stomach pull tight before I knew why. I started tracking moods the way sailors track weather, watching for signs of sudden storms.

The violence didn’t announce itself. It leaked in.

Raised voices. Slamming doors. Objects hitting walls. My mother’s tone changing—sharp, then pleading, then gone quiet in a way that scared me more than yelling ever could.

The night it broke through completely, I was under a thin blanket that smelled like mildew and sweat, twisted tight in my fists. My heart hammered so hard I was sure it could be heard through the walls. Every sound landed inside me like impact.

Please stop.  
No.  
Please.

Glass shattered.

I didn’t move.

I wanted to. Every part of me screamed to run, to help, to do something. But my body didn’t obey. It locked. The same stillness I’d learned in glass and wires came rushing back online.

If I stay quiet, maybe I survive.  
If I don’t move, maybe it passes.

That became the rule.

The violence didn’t always land on us kids, but we felt all of it. I remember peeking through a cracked door once and seeing my mother’s arm hanging wrong—swollen, limp, no longer obeying her. I remember the shape of him in the room, taking up all the air. I remember learning, in that moment, that love could be dangerous and that home could turn hostile without warning.

After that, my body stopped trusting sleep.

I wet the bed long after other kids didn’t. Until I was eleven. Shame soaked into everything. I never talked about it. I just learned to hide evidence. Another survival skill.

Sometimes Child Protective Services showed up at school. Quiet questions. Careful voices. Bruises explained away. My sister and I learned the right answers quickly.

“Only when we’re bad.”

I thought that was how discipline worked.

Some nights, we ran.

My mother would burst into the room, eyes wild, hair tangled, already moving. “Go. Now.” No explanations. No time. Bare feet hit gravel. Cold air tore at my lungs as we ran for my uncle’s house, the only place that felt temporarily solid.

She always lagged behind.

I remember glancing back, seeing a hand catch her arm, seeing her pulled backward while we kept running. Even then, my mind tried to make sense of it.

Why doesn’t she keep running?

It lasted six months.

The relationship ended. The man left. The house went quiet again.

But the storm didn’t.

It had already moved inside.

Around ten, sleep paralysis started. I’d wake frozen, eyes open, chest crushed by an invisible weight. A presence in the room that felt real, close, watching. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t scream. Couldn’t breathe right.

Adults called it nightmares.

My body knew better.

A year later, I heard he was dead. My mother cried on the phone. I waited for relief to arrive.

It didn’t.

Just a flatness. Static. The sense that danger didn’t need a living body to stay real.

What I didn’t understand then—but would learn the hard way later—was that safety isn’t restored just because the threat leaves. Once your body learns the world can flip without warning, it never fully unlearns it.

The glass box taught me stillness.

That house taught me vigilance.

Together, they built something durable and deadly: a nervous system that never stood down, even when the room went quiet.

The storm outside had passed.

The alert never did.
