# Chapter 4 — The First Escapes

<p class="chapter-orientation">Early coping mechanisms and the first patterns of escape.</p>

Relief came before addiction.

That part matters.

My body had been carrying tension for years before I ever touched a substance. By the time I found something that quieted it, I wasn’t looking to get high. I was looking to feel normal. Or at least less alert. Less braced. Less on guard.

The first relief wasn’t dramatic. It was casual. A sip here. A moment there. Adults drinking around me like it was nothing. At four years old, it felt harmless. At sixteen, it felt like an answer.

Alcohol softened the edges. The noise dimmed. My shoulders dropped. The constant internal hum finally went quiet enough for me to breathe. For the first time I could remember, my body wasn’t scanning for exits or waiting for impact.

It felt like peace.

I didn’t think, *This is dangerous.*  
I thought, *This is what everyone else feels like.*

By seventeen, I was chasing that quiet on purpose. Beer turned into liquor. One drink turned into many. I didn’t pace myself because I wasn’t trying to enjoy it—I was trying to arrive somewhere. Somewhere still. Somewhere numb enough that the past couldn’t reach me.

When I drank too much and woke up on a bathroom floor, head against cold tile, throat raw from vomiting, I told myself I’d gone too far.

I didn’t tell myself to stop.

Because even then, the relief outweighed the cost.

Pain found another door in around the same time. Migraines that flattened me. A pill offered without ceremony. Something to “kill the pain.” Thirty minutes later, I was moving again. Cleaning. Functioning. Alive in a way I hadn’t been in years.

It wasn’t euphoria.

It was quiet competence.

The chaos inside me finally lined up into something manageable. I could work. I could focus. I could exist without feeling like I was under constant threat.

So I remembered.

I learned quickly which substances gave me distance from my body and which ones dropped me back into it. I learned how to use relief as a tool. A switch. A way out.

No one had to teach me moderation.  
No one had to warn me about addiction.  

I already knew how to disappear.

Substances didn’t create that instinct. They just made it easier.

At first, it didn’t look like a problem. I was young. Functional. Employed. Capable. If anything, I looked calmer than before. Less anxious. More productive. The kind of person adults like to call “handling it.”

What they didn’t see was the trade I was making.

Every time I chose relief, I reinforced a rule my body already believed:  
**I am not safe unless I am numb.**

That rule worked—until it didn’t.

Because relief has a shelf life.

It always asks for more.  
More volume.  
More frequency.  
More distance.

And eventually, it stops giving what it promised.

I didn’t know any of that yet.

All I knew was that I’d finally found a way to turn the alert down. To step out of the storm for a while. To rest without scanning the room.

Before addiction ever took a name, before consequences stacked up, before anyone called it self-destruction, it was something simpler.

It was escape.

And for a long time, it worked.
