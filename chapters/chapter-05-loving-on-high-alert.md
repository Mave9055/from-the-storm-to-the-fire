# Chapter 5 — Loving on High Alert

<p class="chapter-orientation">Hypervigilance in relationships and the cost of loving while on high alert.</p>

I didn’t fall in love looking for safety.

I fell in love looking for relief.

By the time I met her, my nervous system already knew how to survive chaos. It mistook intensity for connection, volatility for passion, closeness for threat. Calm felt suspicious. Stability felt empty. What I trusted was urgency.

She had that.

She was persistent. Unignorable. She found me when I tried to disappear. If I didn’t answer the phone, she showed up. If I said I was busy, she waited. It didn’t feel invasive at first—it felt like being chosen.

When she got pregnant, something ancient in me snapped into place.

Responsibility.  
Duty.  
Don’t leave. Don’t fail. Don’t repeat the past.

I told myself this was love. But underneath it was something else: terror. The kind that doesn’t feel like fear—it feels like obligation. Like standing watch over something fragile, knowing that if you look away, everything will collapse.

I worked harder. Took more shifts. Said yes more often than no. Built a life as fast as I could, hoping speed would substitute for stability. House. Kids. Routine. On paper, it looked like progress.

Inside, I was braced.

Conflict didn’t feel like disagreement—it felt lethal. Raised voices flipped switches in my body I couldn’t control. My chest tightened. My mind went blank. I learned quickly which parts of myself triggered explosions and started hiding them.

That wasn’t submission.

It was strategy.

When she threatened to leave, my body reacted like it was being abandoned on an operating table. When she withheld affection, I felt it in my gut. When she was cold, I scrambled. I apologized even when I didn’t understand what I’d done wrong. I agreed even when it cost me.

Not because I was weak.

Because my system believed one thing with absolute certainty:  
**Separation equals danger.**

The kids made it worse and better at the same time.

They anchored me. Gave me purpose. Also made leaving feel impossible. Any threat to take them away wasn’t just emotional—it was existential. I would have endured almost anything to keep them close.

So I stayed.

I learned how to disappear in plain sight. How to smooth tension before it turned explosive. How to swallow anger before it showed up in my voice. I stopped asking for comfort. Stopped expecting understanding. I learned to absorb.

I told myself this was what commitment looked like.

Years later, one of my children asked me a question I couldn’t answer.

“Why do you let Mom be so mean to you?”

I didn’t have language for it then. All I had was shame. The realization that what I thought I’d hidden had been visible the whole time.

Love on high alert isn’t love—it’s vigilance wearing a mask.

It’s confusing intensity with intimacy.  
It’s staying because leaving feels like death.  
It’s calling endurance devotion.

I didn’t know any of that yet.

All I knew was that I couldn’t relax. Not in my own house. Not in my own marriage. Not even in moments that were supposed to feel safe.

I wasn’t choosing pain.

I was choosing familiarity.

And familiarity, for me, had always come with a cost.
