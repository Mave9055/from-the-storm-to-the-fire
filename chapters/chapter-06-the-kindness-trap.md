# Chapter 6 — The Kindness Trap

<p class="chapter-orientation">The trap of kindness when your nervous system can't tell safety from danger.</p>

Silence started as protection.

It ended as erasure.

At first, keeping quiet felt smart. Strategic. If I didn’t react, things stayed calmer. If I didn’t push back, the storm passed faster. If I didn’t need anything, nothing could be taken away.

So I learned to compress myself.

I stopped bringing problems home. Stopped talking about grief. Stopped naming exhaustion. Pain became something I managed privately, because sharing it only seemed to make things worse. Every unmet need felt like proof that I was asking for too much.

Eventually, even existing felt negotiable.

There were times I literally hid.

Closets. Bathrooms. Empty rooms with doors shut. When her family visited, I disappeared so I wouldn’t complicate the picture. When my presence caused tension, I removed it. I learned how to become invisible without leaving the house.

It wasn’t metaphor.

I stood in the dark, listening to voices move through rooms I wasn’t allowed to occupy.

That’s what silence costs when it’s practiced long enough: you stop taking up space even when it’s yours.

Shame moved in quietly after that.

It told me this was my fault. That if I were better—calmer, cleaner, easier—none of this would be necessary. I started doubting my own perceptions. If I felt hurt, I questioned whether I was being dramatic. If something felt wrong, I assumed the problem was me.

Gaslighting doesn’t always come from someone else.

Sometimes it’s something you do to yourself to survive.

I learned how to read moods the way others read clocks. How to adjust before conflict arrived. How to preemptively apologize just to keep the temperature down. I called it peacekeeping.

What it really was was self-abandonment.

When I relapsed, silence deepened. Pain wasn’t met with concern—it was met with punishment. Being vulnerable became dangerous. I learned quickly that honesty carried consequences I couldn’t afford.

So I lied.

Not loudly. Not maliciously. Quietly. By omission. By minimizing. By pretending I was fine when I was barely holding together. Silence became a shield, but it also became a cage.

I started feeling like my existence needed justification.

Like love was conditional on performance.  
Like rest was earned, not allowed.  
Like being seen was a risk.

At some point, I couldn’t tell where I ended and the silence began. My thoughts stayed inside my head. My feelings stayed trapped in my chest. Even my body started to fade from my awareness. Hunger. Exhaustion. Pain. All muted.

Disappearing had worked too well.

The cost wasn’t immediate. It accumulated slowly, invisibly, until one day I realized I didn’t know how to speak honestly anymore. Not without fear. Not without rehearsing. Not without bracing for impact.

Silence had kept me safe once.

Now it was hollowing me out.

And I didn’t yet know how to make noise without setting everything on fire.
