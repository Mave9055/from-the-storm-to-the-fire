# Chapter 7 — The Loop

<p class="chapter-orientation">Trauma bonding, repetition compulsion, and the loop that feels like fate.</p>

I used to believe that the opposite of pain was numbness, and I chased it like salvation. What I learned, instead, was that the opposite of pain is **connection**, and connection is the scariest thing of all.

When you grow up learning that the world is a series of escalating threats, your inner narrative is built on two simple, yet devastating, assumptions:

1.  *I am the cause of the threat.*
2.  *I am the solution to the threat.*

This creates what I call **The Loop**: a closed-circuit, self-fulfilling prophecy of relational failure that spins faster and hotter the harder you try to break it.

The Loop has three stages:

### Stage 1: The Fix

Driven by the assumption that *I am the solution*, I enter a relationship not looking for a partner, but for a project. I am hyper-focused on fixing, maintaining, or perfecting the dynamic. I anticipate every need, pre-empt every conflict, and absorb all relational friction. I am not truly present; I am working. The goal isn't connection; it's **control** over the outcome.

### Stage 2: The Inevitable Breach

No amount of work can control another human being. Eventually, they fail to meet my impossible, silent standard, or they simply behave in a way that triggers my core wound. The façade of control shatters. This breach could be minor—a forgotten detail, a night out with friends—but to my survival brain, it is proof of the threat.

### Stage 3: The Confirmation and Retreat

The threat is confirmed: *I am the cause of the threat.* My internal story shifts from "I should have worked harder" to "I am fundamentally unlovable." I retreat, often dramatically, pushing away the person before they can inevitably leave me. This retreat reinforces the belief that I must be the cause because I'm the one who always ends up isolated. The relationship fails, confirming the original assumptions, and I am back at Stage 1, ready for the next project.

My friend Daniel, who managed a wildlife reserve, once explained it to me: "You're living like a solitary animal. You've built a magnificent cage for yourself, and when someone comes close, you treat the proximity as a predation risk. So you bite, not to hurt, but to create the distance you need to feel safe. But every time you bite, you confirm your isolation."

The key to breaking the loop isn't to stop fighting the pain; it's to lower the sword and allow the terrifying risk of connection to enter the cage.
