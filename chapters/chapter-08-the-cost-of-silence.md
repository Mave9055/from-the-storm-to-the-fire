# Chapter 8 — The Cost of Silence

<p class="chapter-orientation">The price of silence and the weight of words left unsaid.</p>

Grief assumes you have somewhere to land.

I didn’t.

When my brother died, everything I had been holding together finally split. Not all at once. Not dramatically. It cracked quietly, the way structures fail when they’ve been carrying too much weight for too long.

The call came when I was away. A voice telling me there’d been a wreck. A tree. Speed. No details that mattered, because none of them could change the outcome.

I remember the moment my body understood before my mind did. My legs gave out. The ground felt too far away. I yelled at the sky—not prayers, not words meant to be heard. Just sound. Rage. Betrayal.

I blamed myself immediately.

If I’d answered sooner.  
If I’d gone back.  
If I’d stayed.

Grief found every existing fault line and widened it. Guilt settled in like a verdict, not a feeling. I replayed my last moments with him until they lost all shape. There was no resolution—only repetition.

When I tried to grieve at home, I learned quickly that there wasn’t space for it.

My pain made others uncomfortable. Tears were an inconvenience. The message was clear: contain it, or take it elsewhere. I learned how to cry silently. How to fold grief inward until it became something heavier than sadness.

That was the first time I realized grief could be dangerous.

It wasn’t just loss—it was exposure. Vulnerability without protection.

I didn’t process my brother’s death.

I survived it.

Years later, my mother died.

By then, my system was already compromised. I’d been running on fumes for years—burning through substances, work, silence, anything that kept me upright. When she collapsed, my body responded the same way it always had.

Freeze.

People shouted. Phones rang. Someone told me to move. I couldn’t. My body locked, the same way it had when I was small, hiding under blankets while the house shook.

I watched instead.

I watched paramedics work. Watched confusion spread across faces. Watched my mother slip away while my body refused to engage. I hated myself for it. But hatred didn’t change the fact that my system had gone offline.

When she died, there was no collapse.

Just emptiness.

Grief didn’t come like waves. It came like absence. A flatness so complete it felt unreal. I avoided the funeral. Avoided the casket. Avoided anything that made the loss tangible. I told myself I was being practical.

I was dissociating.

Loss stacked on loss without pause. There was no space to feel, no place to fall apart safely. So I didn’t. I kept moving. I kept functioning. I kept pretending.

Grief without landing doesn’t heal.

It ferments.

It turns into anger. Into numbness. Into reckless attempts to feel something—anything—that breaks through the fog. It leaks into relationships, decisions, self-destructive choices that don’t look connected until much later.

By the time I noticed how much I’d lost, I was already drowning.

Not because I loved too deeply.

Because I had nowhere to put the love once the people were gone.

Loss didn’t break me.

The lack of safety around it did.

And something inside me finally gave way.
