# Chapter 9 — Escalation

<p class="chapter-orientation">When patterns intensify and the nervous system reaches breaking point.</p>

I thought distance would fix it.

A new place. New job. Clean slate. If I could just get far enough away, maybe the noise would finally quiet down. Maybe the fire would burn itself out without fuel.

It didn’t.

I moved north chasing structure. Work with clear rules. Long hours. Predictable routines. Somewhere cold enough that chaos might freeze.

At first, it worked.

I threw myself into the job the way I always did—full force, no brakes. Learned every position. Took every shift. Closed when others didn’t want to. Cleaned what no one else touched. I worked like six people packed into one body.

They loved me for it.

Praise came fast. Raises followed. I became indispensable again. The miracle phase. I’ve lived there before.

But the fire doesn’t disappear when you feed it work.

It just waits.

When the shifts ended and the doors locked, the silence hit harder. No family. No familiar faces. No buffer. Just me, alone in a small room, my nervous system finally free to do what it does best: replay everything.

Isolation stripped away my last distractions.

That’s when escalation stepped in.

Substances stopped being optional relief and became maintenance. Something to keep me upright. Something to blunt the edge of nights that stretched too long and thoughts that wouldn’t shut up.

I told myself it was temporary. Just to get through. Just until things stabilized.

That lie felt familiar.

The work schedule flipped. Early mornings became impossible. My body wouldn’t move. The same dread rose every time I thought about being seen, evaluated, expected to perform. I’d delay. Circle the building. Enter through the back. Clock in when no one was watching.

When I was late, the shame hit immediately.

Here it comes again.  
You’re failing.  
They’re noticing.  

The loop tightened.

Eventually, the job adjusted. Mornings disappeared. Closings became mine alone. Entire restaurants left in my hands, night after night. Mountains of dishes. Floors. Fryers. Trash. Prep. No help. No pause.

I survived it.

Barely.

And survival came at a cost.

Meth didn’t make me reckless at first. It made me functional. Awake. Focused. Able to push past exhaustion and dread long enough to finish what needed doing. It felt like efficiency. Like control.

That’s how escalation works.

It doesn’t announce itself as destruction.  
It shows up as a solution.

Weeks passed where work was the only place I existed. When I wasn’t there, I stayed hidden. Avoided stores. Avoided people. If something wasn’t stocked at work, I paid someone else to get it. Human interaction felt like walking into traffic.

I wasn’t living.

I was maintaining.

The further I isolated, the more the substances mattered. The more they mattered, the less room there was for anything else. The system fed itself until the edges of my life disappeared completely.

Distance hadn’t fixed anything.

It had just removed witnesses.

Escalation isn’t about wanting more.

It’s about needing the system to keep running when everything else has failed.

And by the time I realized how far it had gone, there was no clean way back.

The fire wasn’t just burning anymore.

It was in control.
