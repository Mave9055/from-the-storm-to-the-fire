# Chapter 10 — The Wrong Diagnoses

<p class="chapter-orientation">Misdiagnosis, wrong treatments, and the search for answers in the wrong frameworks.</p>

When everything finally collapsed, people needed a name for it.

So did I.

Doctors listened in fragments. Ten minutes. Checklists. Symptoms pulled out of context and lined up like evidence. Mood swings. Substance use. Insomnia. Impulsivity. Depression. Anxiety. Anger.

They didn’t ask what came first.

They didn’t ask what my body had learned before my mind ever had a chance.

They gave me labels instead.

Bipolar.  
Major depressive disorder.  
Generalized anxiety.  

Each diagnosis came with a prescription. Each prescription came with side effects. Some flattened me. Some agitated me. Some made the fire burn hotter instead of cooler. When they didn’t work, the assumption wasn’t that the map was wrong—it was that I wasn’t compliant enough.

I tried harder.

I swallowed pills on schedules I didn’t believe in. I tracked moods I didn’t understand. I learned how to describe my pain in ways that fit intake forms. I became fluent in pathology.

None of it made me safer.

The problem with the diagnoses wasn’t that they were malicious. It was that they were incomplete. They described what I did when overwhelmed, not why overwhelm was constant. They named behaviors without naming origins.

They treated my reactions as malfunctions instead of adaptations.

No one asked about the glass box.  
No one asked about the house that shook at night.  
No one asked about freezing, hiding, staying quiet to survive.  

They saw fire and assumed the spark was internal.

I started believing them.

I thought I was unstable. Broken. Chemically defective. That if I could just find the right combination of medications, I’d finally become normal—whatever that meant. Every failed treatment reinforced the same story: *I’m the problem.*

But something didn’t add up.

Even at my worst, my reactions made sense to me. They weren’t random. They followed patterns. Stress led to collapse. Closeness led to panic. Silence led to numbness. Loss led to shutdown.

That isn’t chaos.

That’s a system doing exactly what it was built to do.

The crack came when someone finally asked a different question.

“What happened to you?”

Not what symptoms do you have.  
Not how intense are they.  

What happened.

I didn’t have an answer ready. The story came out sideways. Pieces. The NICU. The house. The running. The hiding. The losses. The way my body never stood down even when life looked stable on paper.

For the first time, my past wasn’t treated like background noise.

It was treated like the blueprint.

Trauma doesn’t look like one thing. It doesn’t announce itself cleanly. Sometimes it looks like anger. Sometimes like withdrawal. Sometimes like addiction. Sometimes like competence pushed too far.

Misdiagnosis isn’t just incorrect labeling.

It’s a missed opportunity to understand why the fire exists at all.

The problem wasn’t that I had too much emotion.

It was that my system had been living in emergency mode for decades without relief.

The diagnoses weren’t wrong.

They just weren’t deep enough.

And for the first time, I started to suspect that what I’d been fighting wasn’t a broken brain—

—but a body that never learned it was safe.
