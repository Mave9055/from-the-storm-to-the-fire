# Chapter 15 — Parenting From the Fire

<p class="chapter-orientation">Parenting from a dysregulated nervous system and breaking generational patterns.</p>

Becoming a parent didn’t heal me.

It exposed me.

I loved my children immediately and without question. That part was never in doubt. The problem was that love didn’t arrive alone—it arrived carrying everything I’d never resolved. Every place I was still braced. Every fear I hadn’t named. Every instinct to protect without knowing how to feel safe myself.

I wanted to be present.

I didn’t always know how.

There were moments of tenderness that felt almost unbearable. Holding them while they slept. Watching them concentrate on something simple. Hearing them laugh freely, without scanning the room first. Those moments cracked something open in me—and right behind the tenderness came grief.

They were safe in ways I never was.

I wanted to give them everything I didn’t have. Patience. Stability. Emotional consistency. A nervous system that didn’t spike at noise or shut down under stress. I tried to build that with willpower alone.

It doesn’t work that way.

When I was regulated, I was deeply attuned. Curious. Playful. Protective in healthy ways. But when my system tipped into survival, parenting became something else entirely. I withdrew. Snapped. Overcorrected. Oscillated between overinvolvement and disappearance.

I hated myself for that.

The shame was immediate and corrosive. *They deserve better than this.* I promised myself constantly that I’d do better tomorrow. Be calmer. Be more patient. Be the father they needed instead of the one my body kept delivering under pressure.

Sometimes I succeeded.

Sometimes I didn’t.

What made it worse was how invisible it all looked from the outside. I showed up. Paid bills. Took responsibility. I wasn’t absent in the ways people recognize as failure. That made it harder to admit how much I was struggling internally.

Trauma doesn’t make you love your children less.

It makes you afraid of failing them.

That fear followed me everywhere. It made every mistake feel catastrophic. Every raised voice feel unforgivable. I didn’t just regret those moments—I stored them like evidence. Proof that I was damaging the very people I wanted to protect.

I saw it in their faces sometimes.

Confusion. Caution. The same scanning I recognized from my own childhood.

That recognition cut deep.

I didn’t want to pass the fire down.

But wanting isn’t enough when your nervous system is still on high alert. Kids don’t just respond to words—they respond to tone, pacing, presence. They feel regulation long before they understand intention.

I loved them from a body that didn’t yet know how to rest.

Parenting from the fire means holding two truths at once: deep devotion and deep limitation. It means loving fiercely while also carrying the weight of what you can’t yet give consistently.

For a long time, I thought acknowledging that made me a bad father.

Now I know it makes me an honest one.

Naming the fire didn’t absolve me of responsibility. But it did give me a path forward—one rooted in regulation instead of guilt, repair instead of perfection.

My children didn’t need a flawless parent.

They needed a human one.

One willing to see the fire, take responsibility for it, and learn—slowly—how not to let it speak for him anymore.
