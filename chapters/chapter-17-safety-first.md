# Chapter 17 — Safety First

<p class="chapter-orientation">The search for safety and what it means to finally stand down.</p>

Healing didn’t start with insight.

It started with safety.

That was a hard truth to accept, because I’d spent years trying to think my way out of pain. I read books. Learned the language. Understood the patterns. None of that changed the fact that my body still reacted like danger was imminent.

Insight without safety just makes you more aware of how bad things feel.

For a long time, I treated healing like a personal failing. If I just tried harder, disciplined myself more, stayed sober longer, worked deeper in therapy—eventually something would click.

It didn’t.

What finally shifted things wasn’t a breakthrough.

It was a boundary.

I started paying attention to what made my nervous system spike and what allowed it to settle. Not what *should* feel safe, but what actually did. Certain people. Certain environments. Certain expectations. Certain rhythms.

Some of them surprised me.

Chaos felt familiar but destructive.  
Silence felt peaceful but lonely.  
Structure helped—until it became pressure.  

Safety turned out to be specific, not abstract.

I had to make changes that didn't look heroic. Leaving situations that kept me dysregulated. Reducing exposure instead of increasing tolerance. **Choosing boring over volatile. Predictable over exciting. Calm over chemistry.**

It felt wrong at first.

My body was so used to intensity that safety felt like emptiness. Stillness felt like depression. Rest felt like giving up. I had to learn—slowly—that peace doesn't come with fireworks.

It comes with breath.

## Dismantling the NICU System

What I was really doing was **purposefully dismantling the lesson from childhood**: that intensity equals connection. That chaos means you matter. That alarms are the only form of arms.

In the NICU, in the glass box, I learned that stillness and silence were survival. That needing too much was dangerous. That the world beyond the transparent wall was loud and visible but never fully reachable.

Choosing predictable over exciting wasn't settling. It was **choosing to finally live outside the NICU system**—outside the cycle of alarms pretending to be connection.

**Alarms instead of arms.** That's what I'd been living on. The spike of adrenaline mistaken for intimacy. The crisis mistaken for care.

Safety meant learning that I could be held without an emergency. That I could be seen without performing. That I could need things without triggering abandonment.

It meant stepping outside the Glass Box—not by shattering it, but by learning I was no longer trapped inside.

Creating safety wasn’t about avoiding life.

It was about giving my system proof that nothing terrible would happen if I stopped bracing.

That meant sleeping regular hours. Eating consistently. Not overloading my schedule. Saying no without explaining myself. Letting myself leave when things felt overwhelming instead of forcing endurance.

None of that fixed everything.

But it stopped the bleeding.

Safety didn’t cure the fire.

It contained it.

For the first time, my nervous system had space to downshift without punishment. The alarm didn’t shut off completely, but it stopped screaming. Moments of calm stretched longer. Flashbacks passed faster. The urge to disappear softened.

Healing didn’t look like transformation.

It looked like stabilization.

And stabilization turned out to be the foundation everything else needed.

You can’t build a life on a system that’s still fighting for survival.

Safety comes first.

Everything else comes later.
