# Chapter 18 — Learning Regulation

<p class="chapter-orientation">Learning nervous system regulation after a lifetime of dysregulation.</p>


I didn’t need to understand my trauma better.

I needed my body to calm the hell down.

For years, I thought healing meant insight. If I could just explain myself accurately enough—trace every reaction back to its origin—something would unlock. I became fluent in theory while my nervous system stayed on high alert.

Knowledge didn’t regulate me.

Practice did.

Regulation isn’t about being calm all the time. It’s about having a wider range before you tip into survival. It’s about catching the spiral earlier. Recovering faster. Staying present long enough to make a different choice.

That learning doesn’t happen through logic.

It happens through repetition.

I started small. Almost insultingly small. Slowing my breathing when my chest tightened. Putting my feet on the floor and naming what I could see. Taking breaks before exhaustion forced them. **Letting my body move instead of freezing it in place.**

None of it felt impressive.

Some of it felt pointless.

But something subtle shifted. My reactions didn't vanish, but they softened. The edge dulled. I noticed space where there hadn't been any before—a half-second pause between trigger and response.

That pause mattered.

It meant my nervous system was learning a new option.

## Movement as the Antidote to Stillness

What I didn't realize at first was that these small movements—breathing, feet on the floor, shifting my posture—were the **direct opposite of the traumatic freeze response** I'd learned as a child.

In the NICU, in the glass box, in the moments of violence, **I didn't move. My body locked.** Stillness was survival. Silence was safety. Movement meant risk.

Regulation wasn't just about calming down. It was about **teaching my body that it was finally safe to move again.**

**Movement as the antidote to mandated stillness.** Not grand gestures. Not performance. Just the quiet reclaiming of agency over a body that had been trained to freeze.

Every breath I chose to slow was a counter-lesson to the breath I'd held in terror. Every time I planted my feet and named what I could see, I was proving to my nervous system that I was no longer trapped behind the transparent wall, watching life happen somewhere else.

This wasn't just coping. It was **rebuilding from the ground up.**

I learned that regulation isn’t about suppressing emotion. It’s about staying present *with* it. Letting sensations rise and fall without immediately escaping, numbing, or overfunctioning.

That was uncomfortable.

My body was used to extremes. All or nothing. Push or collapse. Regulation lived in the middle, and the middle felt unfamiliar.

Sometimes I mistook regulation for boredom.

Sometimes I mistook calm for depression.

Sometimes I wanted the fire back just so I could feel something decisive again.

That didn’t mean regulation wasn’t working.

It meant my system was recalibrating.

Progress wasn’t linear. Some days I felt grounded. Other days I snapped, shut down, or disappeared. The difference was that I noticed sooner—and repaired faster. Shame didn’t spiral as far. Recovery didn’t take as long.

I stopped treating setbacks like proof I was broken.

They were part of learning.

Regulation didn’t make life easy.

It made it possible.

It gave me access to choice where there had only been reflex. It allowed me to respond instead of react. To stay in the room instead of vanishing. To feel without immediately needing to escape.

That’s not enlightenment.

That’s skill.

And skills can be practiced.

Slowly. Imperfectly. Over time.

For the first time, healing wasn’t something I was chasing.

It was something I was learning to inhabit.
