The fire never went out.

That’s the part most stories get wrong.

I didn’t heal into someone calm, unbothered, or endlessly regulated. I didn’t arrive at peace and stay there. The alarm still sounds sometimes. Old patterns still surface under stress. The body remembers what it learned early.

What changed wasn’t the fire.

It was my relationship to it.

I stopped treating it like an enemy. Stopped trying to extinguish it through force or shame. The fire wasn’t proof that I was failing—it was proof that something in me had survived conditions that demanded it burn.

I learned to listen instead of react.

When the heat rises now, I ask different questions. *What feels unsafe? What boundary was crossed? What part of me is trying to protect something old?* The answers aren’t always clear, but the asking slows me down.

Slowing down changed everything.

I don’t disappear the way I used to. I don’t stay silent at any cost. I don’t confuse endurance with love or chaos with connection. When I feel myself bracing, I notice it sooner. When I misstep, I repair faster.

That isn’t mastery.

It’s presence.

Some days I still grieve what was lost. Some days the loneliness hums again. Some days I feel the old urge to outrun myself through work, distraction, or noise. Healing didn’t erase those impulses—it gave me choice around them.

Choice is quieter than transformation.

But it’s real.

I am still learning how to live without armor. Still learning that safety can be built, not earned. Still learning that rest doesn’t mean collapse and boundaries don’t mean abandonment.

I don’t measure progress by how little I feel anymore.

I measure it by how much I can stay.

Stay with discomfort.  
Stay in conversation.  
Stay present with my kids, my body, my life.  

The fire still burns.

But it no longer runs the house.

I am not cured.

I am not finished.

I am here.

And for the first time, that feels like enough.
