## About This Memoir

This is a memoir about **Complex PTSD** — not as a diagnosis, but as a lived biological reality.

The story is told **backwards**: from adult survival patterns, emotional armor, and burnout back to their developmental and neurological origins.

It begins with symptoms and coping strategies — and works relentlessly back to where the nervous system learned danger.

**This book is for people who were never fragile — only trained, early, to survive.**
