# From the Storm to the Fire

**Trauma doesn't fade. It rewires.**

This is a memoir about Complex PTSD — not as a diagnosis, but as a lived nervous-system reality.  
It is told **backwards**: starting with adulthood survival patterns and tracing them relentlessly back to their origins.

This book is for people who were never "dramatic," never "weak," never "broken" — just wired for danger too early and for too long.

## The Book

**From the Storm to the Fire** explores the lived experience of complex trauma through the lens of the "Glass Box Blueprint"—a framework that connects NICU beginnings, hypervigilance, attachment wounds, sensory overload, addiction, relationships, and avoidance into one coherent story of survival and meaning-making.

This isn't a book about healing — it's a war story. We start where most memoirs end — with survival — and work our way to meaning.

## About This Memoir

This memoir does three things:

1. **Punches you in the chest early** with brutally vivid, instantly memorable writing
2. **Lets you recognize yourself** without feeling lectured or pathologized  
3. **Gives you language** for pain you already feel but couldn't name

It's written in a hybrid style—visceral and literary in the early chapters, grounded and reflective in the middle, conceptual synthesis at the end. The science is embedded in lived experience, not lectured. The trauma is real, but so is the meaning.

This book is what I wish I had at 13, 23, and hell — still wish I had now.
