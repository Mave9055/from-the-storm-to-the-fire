# From the Storm to the Fire

**A memoir of a life lived on high alert.**

This is a journey from damage to meaning to agency—a story about healing complex trauma, told backwards. From the storm outside to the fire inside, through survival adaptations and their consequences.

---

## The Book

**From the Storm to the Fire** explores the lived experience of complex trauma through the lens of the "Glass Box Blueprint"—a framework that connects NICU beginnings, hypervigilance, attachment wounds, sensory overload, addiction, relationships, and avoidance into one coherent story of survival and meaning-making.

### Structure

**Part I: Wiring (Chapters 1–3)**  
The early blueprint: NICU, domestic violence, sleep paralysis, and the nervous system adaptations that became a way of life.

**Part II: Burning (Chapters 4–6)**  
The collapse: twenty years of static, the breaking point, and what happens when the old strategies stop working.

**Part III: Rising (Chapters 7–10)**  
The reconstruction: adrift in North Dakota, anatomy of a spiral, decoding the fire, and synthesizing the Glass Box Blueprint.

**Epilogue: Still Burning, Still Here**  
What comes after the story ends.

## About

This memoir does three things:

1. **Punches you in the chest early** with brutally vivid, instantly memorable writing
2. **Lets you recognize yourself** without feeling lectured or pathologized  
3. **Gives you language** for pain you already feel but couldn't name

It's written in a hybrid style—visceral and literary in the early chapters, grounded and reflective in the middle, conceptual synthesis at the end. The science is embedded in lived experience, not lectured. The trauma is real, but so is the meaning.
