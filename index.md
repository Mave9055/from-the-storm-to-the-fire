# From the Storm to the Fire

**A memoir of a life lived on high alert.**

This is a journey from damage to meaning to agency—a story about healing complex trauma, told backwards. From the storm outside to the fire inside, through survival adaptations and their consequences.

---

## The Book

**From the Storm to the Fire** explores the lived experience of complex trauma through the lens of the "Glass Box Blueprint"—a framework that connects NICU beginnings, hypervigilance, attachment wounds, sensory overload, addiction, relationships, and avoidance into one coherent story of survival and meaning-making.

### Structure

**Act I: Wiring (Chapters 1–4)**  
The early blueprint: NICU, domestic violence, sleep paralysis, and the nervous system adaptations that became a way of life.

**Act II: Fire (Chapters 5–9)**  
The patterns emerge: loving on high alert, the kindness trap, the loop, the cost of silence, and escalation.

**Act III: Healing (Chapters 10–13)**  
Understanding the damage: wrong diagnoses, the Glass Box Blueprint, emotional flashbacks, and survival roles.

**Act IV: Cost (Chapters 14–17)**  
The consequences: the life not lived, parenting from the fire, loneliness beneath the noise, and the search for safety.

**Act V: Ember (Chapter 22)**  
What comes after the story ends.

**Appendix: Toolkit (Chapters 18–20)**  
Practical frameworks for regulation, boundaries, and continued healing.

## About

This memoir does three things:

1. **Punches you in the chest early** with brutally vivid, instantly memorable writing
2. **Lets you recognize yourself** without feeling lectured or pathologized  
3. **Gives you language** for pain you already feel but couldn't name

It's written in a hybrid style—visceral and literary in the early chapters, grounded and reflective in the middle, conceptual synthesis at the end. The science is embedded in lived experience, not lectured. The trauma is real, but so is the meaning.
