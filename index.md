# From the Storm to the Fire

**Trauma doesn't fade.  
It wires itself into the nervous system.**

This is a memoir about Complex PTSD — not as a diagnosis, but as a lived biological reality.

The story is told **backwards**:  
from adult survival patterns, emotional armor, and burnout  
back to their developmental and neurological origins.

It begins with symptoms and coping strategies — and works relentlessly back to where the nervous system learned danger.

This book is for people who were never fragile —  
only trained, early, to survive.

## About This Memoir

This memoir does three things:

1. **Punches you in the chest early** with brutally vivid, instantly memorable writing
2. **Lets you recognize yourself** without feeling lectured or pathologized  
3. **Gives you language** for pain you already feel but couldn't name

It's written in a hybrid style—visceral and literary in the early chapters, grounded and reflective in the middle, conceptual synthesis at the end. The science is embedded in lived experience, not lectured. The trauma is real, but so is the meaning.
