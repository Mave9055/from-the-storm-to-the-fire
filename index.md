## About This Memoir

This is a memoir about **Complex PTSD** — not as a diagnosis, but as a lived biological reality.

The story is told **backwards**: from adult survival patterns, emotional armor, and burnout back to their developmental and neurological origins.

It begins with symptoms and coping strategies — and works relentlessly back to where the nervous system learned danger.

**This book is for people who were never fragile — only trained, early, to survive.**

## The Complete Manuscript

**20 chapters across four acts** — from the NICU to Complex PTSD, from meaning to debt, and finally to agency and healing.

### Act I: The Adult Defense — Working Back to the Blueprint of Wiring
How survival patterns formed in the body: tracing current hypervigilance back to the NICU, domestic violence, sleep paralysis, and the nervous system adaptations that became a way of life.

### Act II: The Cost of High Alert — Tracing Current Patterns Back to the Fire
