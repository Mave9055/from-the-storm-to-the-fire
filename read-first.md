## Before You Read (Content Note + How to Use This Book)

This is a **raw trauma memoir** — not a gentle step-by-step guide.  
It's told **backwards**: from adult survival patterns back to where the nervous system learned danger.

### Content Note (read this like a seatbelt)

This book may include (directly or indirectly):

- medical trauma / early-life survival stress
- domestic violence and unstable home dynamics
- panic, dissociation, sleep disturbance, emotional flashbacks
- addiction recovery themes and nervous-system dysregulation

If you're currently unsafe, fragile, or in active crisis: **do not "push through."** Pause and come back with support.

### How to Use This Book (so it helps instead of wrecking you)

- **Don't binge.** One chapter at a time is the move.
- **Read from safety.** Have a grounding move ready (breathing, cold water, "5 things you can see," etc.).
- **Read for language.** Highlight lines that name what you've lived.
- **Skip ahead on purpose.** If Acts I–III hit too hard, jump to **Act IV ("Agency")** and start at **["Safety First."](/from-the-storm-to-the-fire/chapters/chapter-17-safety-first.html)**

### If you need support right now (U.S.)

- **Call/Text/Chat 988** — Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- **Domestic violence support:** 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)
- **Substance use / treatment referral:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357)
